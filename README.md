Input and output judger for OIers and *For Humansâ„¢*.

This project aims at creating an extensible interface for judging OI programs
with Python, universally compatible at all platforms, i.e. Linux and Windows
<del>and macOS</del>. All interfaces should be reusable and universally
compatible, emulating down to simple functions.

A command line interface is provided for rapid invocation of this module, while
a Python library is also made available to those who wish to create Online
Judges or Offline Judges with this module.
